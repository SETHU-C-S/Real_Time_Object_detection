# Real Time Object Detection using YOLOv5 Algorithm in Python

This repository contains Python code implementing real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient implementation for real-time object detection tasks.

## Features

- Utilizes YOLOv5 algorithm for real-time object detection.
- Written in Python for ease of use and integration.
- Provides support for real-time inference on various input sources such as images, video streams, and live camera feeds.
- Offers easy-to-understand codebase for both inference and training purposes.
- Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment and experimentation.
- Supports customization for specific object detection tasks and datasets.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
